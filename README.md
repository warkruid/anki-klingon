# anki-klingon
Generate an anki flashcard package from the Klingon Dictionary wordlist

# History
When I started to study some klingon, I wanted to use [anki flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) on android to start to learn a vocabulary.
I soon discovered that none of the publicly available packages were sufficient. So I set out to create my own with the [genanki package](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki)

# Usage
python gendict.py -i klingon-english.csv<br>
python gendict.py -i english-klingon.csv

# Todo items
* Generate english-klingon (DONE)
* Add images (copyright free, non-commercial? CC license?)
* Add sound (kli text to speech converter? ask permission!)
* better layout of flashcard
* change to boQwI as a source of words? (ask permission!)
